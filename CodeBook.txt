Codebook for AllSensorData.txt and AllSensorData_Summarized.txt
========================================================

Accelerometer data was generated by differnt subjects carrying a Samsung Galaxy S while carrying out one of six different activities.  A given subject may have been tested multiple times carrying out the same activity.  

Raw Data:  The following files
* Training data set
    * X_train.txt - rows are vectors of measured and calculated sensor data for a subject conducting an activity
    * y_train.txt - Activity codes for the rows of X_train.txt
    * subject_train.txt - Subject ids for the rows of X_train.txt
* Test data set
    * X_test.txt - rows are vectors of measured and calculated sensor data for a subject conducting an activity
    * y_test.txt - Activity codes for the rows of X_train.txt
    * subject_test.txt - Subject ids for the rows of X_train.txt
* Files with labels and keys
    * features.txt - names of the 561 variables in the columns of X_train.txt and X_test.txt
    * activity_labels.txt - text descriptions of th activity codes in y_train.txt and y_test.txt

Processed Data:  The following files
* AllSensorData.txt
    * Combines measurements from training and data sets
    * 3 fields for experimental conditions:
        SubjectID (an integer indicating the subject being measured)
        ActivtityID (an integer indicating the type of activity being analyzed)
        Activity (a text description of the activity)
    * 66 fields for measured or calculated sensor data with following naming convention AAA_BBB_C
        AAA is text indicating the type of measured or calculated sensor signal
        BBB is "mean" or "std" indicating if the value is the mean or standard deviation of the signal
        C is "X", "Y", or "Z" indicating the axis for the accelorometer sensor measurement
    * Each row represents on experiment where one subject carried out one activity
* AllSensorData.txt
    * Same data and fields as for AllSensorData.txt except
    * Each measured/calculated field is summarized by averaging by SubjectID and ActivityID
    * Each row has one unique combination of SubjectID and ActivityID

Data processing was carried out using the following R script
* run_analysis.R
